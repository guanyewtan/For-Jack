                    <h2 class = "sectionheader"> My Favorites</h2>
                    <p> Apart from hentai, I'm actually an avid fan of ultimate, more
                        commonly known as "frisbee". I love the rush of adrenaline
                        when my tiny legs start pumpin dem good blood into the glorious organ,
                        and leaping for discs gives me a certain level of connection to Kouco that I 
                        just can't seem to explain. <br>
                        I also love coaching my failed disciple, XxIIxX, despite knowing he is a failure,
                        as it brings me joy to see him struggle with the shitty advice I give him on how to 
                        git good at bastion. <br>
                        Looking at luke gives me a lukewarm sensation in my pants. I thoroughly enjoy luke's 
                        luscious lubricant of lusty luminous luck while licking lizards lazing later, laying low while
                        lying on lavishly lathered leather, littering the little light LEDs looking like lovely lemons. <br>
                        Leap. Label. Link. Leopard. Should be studying but I'm doing this shit instead lol.
